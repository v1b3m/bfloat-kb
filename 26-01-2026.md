- We could connect northflank that will enable users deploy web apps
	- Bring your own cloud
	- This could enable us to allow users to deploy to GCP using our credits
- Soft launch this week
	- A place where we can successfully build for MacOS and windows
	- Auto updates
	- Everything is kind of already set up
	- When a new version is pushed to the aws bucket, users will be automatically prompted to update
	- Deploy a full on backend
	- `bfloat.dev` the new site

- `build:mac:publish` works
- Atem to send new .env
- Northflank supports deployment of repos from git
	- They don't have gitea support
	- Claude suggested doing the cloud builds (cloud run) using gcp and then getting northflank to deploy to the image
	- Stuck at the registry stage
	- Cloud Build -> Northflank gets the built image > Northflank deploys that image

- Artifact Registry Writer
- How to get the registry working with Northflank?
	- Might need to add a cluster?

- for some reason they only support Gitea
- Should we move to GitLab
- Play around with the platform and see
- GitLab requires paying once you reach a certain threshold

---

1. Once the clusters complete setup, I should be able to create a project
2. the branch is `feature/northflank-web-deploy` in `bfloat-app-ide`

Landing
Login
Auth

Everything else goes
- Workbench, etc must all go
- We only want to use the app engineer for login, and downloading the app
