Deploy step is now failing with 

```
To upgrade, run:
npm install -g eas-cli
Proceeding with outdated version.

Run this command inside a project directory.
    Error: build command failed.
```

The deploy button is on the project page

---
✅

What happened to the way files were being loaded when the project is opened. I think this was changed?

---
✅

Can we have temporary files for empty projects for now so I can continue with my work of deployment?

---
✅
 
Add debug logs, the deploy buttons are disabled

### Issue 01 ✅

This is not rendering correctly

```
1G⠇⠏★ eas-cli@16.28.0 is now available. To upgrade, run: npm install -g eas-cli Proceeding with outdated version. Using EAS CLI without version control system is not recommended, use this mode only if you know what you are doing. EAS project not configured. [?25l? Would you like to automatically create an EAS project for @bfloat/my-app? › (Y/n)
```

All I am seeing in the UI is

```
> (
```

Something probably broken with the parsing

However, for this step I get the correct UI

**Step**

```
, but without Apple account access you will need to provide all the missing values manually and we can only run minimal validation on them. [?25l? Do you want to log in to your Apple account? › (Y/n)
```

**Output**

```
Sign in to Apple Developer Account?\n\nEAS needs to authenticate with your Apple Developer account to manage certificates and submit to TestFlight.
```

Similarly, for this step, this is what I get

### Issue 2 ✅

We need to handle this step better

```
? Select a Provider › 
❯   Bfloat Inc (121504122)
    Atem Atem (127843537)
```

I can see all these options, why?

```
Yes(y) No(n) Enter 1 2
```

I also see an input where I can enter text (this one is fine). However, I don't think I need to see all the above options as some of them make no sense

---
### Issue 03 ✅
 
```
✖ The bundle identifier com.example.myapp is not available to team "Bfloat Inc (Company/Organization)" (2WSKRS5VW4), change it in your app config and try again.
An attribute in the provided entity has invalid value - An App ID with Identifier 'com.example.myapp' is not available. Please enter a different string.
    Error: build command failed.
```

let's maybe use com.bfloat.[random-compatible-string]

### Issue 04 ✅

Some of these details seem unnecessary for non-technical users

```
Key ID: 7TW533F77Y Name: [Expo] EAS Submit J04Ufm_Rxb Team ID: 2WSKRS5VW4, Team name: Bfloat Inc (Company/Organization) Updated: 1 day ago › (
```

Does this even make sense to someone non-technical?

Can we automatically submit yes for recommended commands?

We need to have as little human intervention as possible.

I think this can abstract away some of these technicalities
