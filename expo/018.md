I have a personal account that expo is connected to, however, I also have a team account connected to the same personal account. I should be able to change to use the paid team account for faster builds.

The free builds can at times wait in queue for hours.

1. Does this require getting a new bundle identifier linked to the team account?
2. How do I know which account an app is linked to?
3. What's a good UI and backend to changing between connected accounts?
4.
