I see we have the npx testflight running in a mini terminal window in the popover

1. Can we have it running inside another tab in the main terminal window on the project page?
   1. Can we also have this tab as the main one while deployment runs?
2. Can we have `npx testflight` run with `-y` so all requires installs are automatically done?
3. "📝 iOS Bundle Identifier Learn more: https://expo.fyi/bundle-identifier
   ? What would you like your iOS bundle identifier to be? ›" Users do not want to deal with this? Can we automate this step?
4. The user should simply press a button and everything is automated
5. Perhaps they can be implored to log into expo and app store connect, that should be enough
