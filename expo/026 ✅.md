Could we instead of triggering auto inputs offer users with options along with meanings?

For example instead of automatically hitting y, we provide two buttons with y/n along with what each means?

Instead of hitting enter, we present the user with buttons along with each option means?

, but without Apple account access you will need to provide all the missing values manually and we can only run minimal validation on them. [?25l? Do you want to log in to your Apple account? › (Y/n)
```

This triggers these buttons:

```html
<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-3 justify-center">
  <button
    type="button"
    class="px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-sm font-medium transition-colors disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90"
  >
    Yes, sign in<span class="ml-2 text-xs opacity-75">(Recommended)</span></button
  ><button
    type="button"
    class="px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-sm font-medium transition-colors disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed bg-muted hover:bg-muted/80 text-foreground"
  >
    No, skip
  </button>
</div>

```

On clicking, I get this error in the console

```txt

```

The same buttons are then rendered once again.

However, there's now an extra line

```
✔ Do you want to log in to your Apple account? … yes [?25h › Log in to your Apple Developer account to continue ? Apple ID: › y
```

The `Apple ID: › y` appears to be cached from previous inputs, it should be `Apple ID: › ben@bfloat.ai`

Can we trigger the app store login with the email and password the user input in the previous step via cli args?
