- Added account selection defaulting to organization accounts
- Should complete the iOS deployments today
- 5 Step process
- I understand the login flow includes a sign in to expo step, however, since we're logging into the cli, users will be prompted to sign in again during deployments
	- The other option is to store their credentials, I don't think we want to do this
- I have some ideas for UI like making the deploy wizard wider which you can then iterate on to improve
- No need to panic
