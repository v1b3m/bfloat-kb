✅

The app is broken

```sh
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "./ChatInput" from "app/components/chat/Chat.tsx". Does the file exist?

/Users/v1b3m/Dev/bfloat/bfloat-ide/app/components/chat/Chat.tsx:19:26

16 |  import { useConveyor } from "@/app/hooks/use-conveyor";
17 |  import { Messages } from "./Messages";
18 |  import { ChatInput } from "./ChatInput";
   |                             ^
19 |  import { ErrorMessage } from "./ErrorMessage";
20 |  import { TaskProgress } from "./TaskProgress";
```

Look into this issue and figure out what's going on

I can see a downward arrow below the chat input, where's that from?

---

There's a nice agent selector for claude/codex at the Home page

Could we maybe reuse that instead of the select as it's more beautiful.

I think you forgot to make some changes to develop which broke the app. I've pushed a fix [here](https://github.com/bfloat-inc/bfloat-ide/pull/27), let me know what you think.

The new UI looks great by the way, kudos!
