We are building a deploy to ios app store feature

git diff against origin/develop to see all the changes we've made so far

```sh
git diff origin/develop
```

We are currently facing the bug described in @bfloat-ide-pg/expo/013.md

Document what we're working on and where we are at and place that in @bfloat-ide-pg/expo/knowledge-base.md then after come up with a plan to resolve the bug
