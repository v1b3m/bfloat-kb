I still feel like users having to type into a tiny modal UI is not good UX. Can you come up with an alternative to this? What do we have on the table? Is this really the best way forward? Can we automate every step?

Can we know when feedback is needed from users and show a custom input UI? Perhaps even clickable buttons (Yes / No), (Accept / Deny)

We are brainstorming here so the sky is the limit
