We should detect if users have already set up before so users do not have to keep inputting the password and email each time.

The terminal needs to be optimized to always render stuff

---

Specialized sub agent that does deploys to app stores. This is a much more smooth flow. We can just listen to these kinds of errors

`launch.expo.dev` 

---

`react-native-worklets` bug

This issue happens in the default template

---

Custom `.bfloat/` folder has a `launch.json` file that has commands for setting up projects and stuff from any arbitrary web project. We just clone the repo, run claude code to analyze and fill in the necessary `launch.json` commands and then we can run any project locally.

---

We also have a new domain `https://bfloat.dev`

Agent sessions are unreliable

---

Reliability

1. 
2. Session stuff, we can load the session but there's a weird bug
3. Session Id is stored on the project record in the db, we use that session Id to claude/codex so it initiates that session Id.
4. `feature/launch-json-config` branch merge.
	1. We should prioritize changes inside this branch over older ones
	2. Both `bfloat-app-engineer` and `bfloat-ide` have this branch
5.
