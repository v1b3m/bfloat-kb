I stil had to manually accept these commands. We need to automate these, lets do some research here and automate this.

```
✔ Would you like us to run 'git init' in /Users/v1b3m/.bfloat/project-6bb514c0-a38e-4ac2-804e-c81cea6c4726 for you? … yes
We're going to make an initial commit for your repository.
✔ Commit message: … Initial commit
✔ Generated eas.json. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/eas-json/
EAS project not configured.
✔ Existing EAS project found for @ben_afloat/bfloat-app (id = 9c916824-562a-4d92-97ed-881476607bb1). Configure this project? … yes
```

It's also asking me to add a bundle identifier? What have you cooked for 12 minutes for? Only one requirement is working i.e running in the main terminal window.
