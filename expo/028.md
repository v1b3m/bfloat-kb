Let's cache the email somewhere so the user doesn't have to keep inputting it into the deploy to iOS modal. For the password, we can leave it for security reasons

We're storing the wrong error message

```
Build failed [copy icon]

Retry build
```

Clicking copy copies `Build failed`

However, I can see in the terminal

```
Waiting for build to complete. You can press Ctrl+C to exit.
✖ Build failed

🍏 iOS build failed:
Unknown error. See logs of the Prebuild build phase for more information.
