The deploy modal is not correctly identifying when the build is complete:

The full logs copy is at `/Users/v1b3m/Dev/bfloat/bfloat-ide/bfloat-ide-pg/deploy.txt`

At the end is showed `Building iosa app as the last step`

The line we should be looking out for is

```
✔ Build finished 🍏 iOS app: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/QmMYLtvujEmfGPJ6JPsBA.ipa
