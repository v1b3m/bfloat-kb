1. Get rid of the project page along with any files it imports
2. We are maintaining only the landing page, auth, and user settings

1. I see you removed git and gitea files too, we need to keep these
	1. app/lib/project-storage/git-storage.service.ts
	2. app/lib/project-storage/gitea-user.service.ts
	3. Any related files...
